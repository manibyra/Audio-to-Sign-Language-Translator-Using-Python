# Audio-to-Sign-Language-Translator-Using-Python
This system converts spoken language into sign language using speech recognition and animated sign gestures. It processes audio input, converts it to text, and maps it to corresponding sign language signs. Implemented using Python and Django, it helps bridge communication between the hearing and deaf communities.
